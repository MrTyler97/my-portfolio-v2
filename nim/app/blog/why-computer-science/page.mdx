## Italy 2018

After I graduated with my Associate's, I treated myself to a trip to Italy with some family. On the trip, I got to reconnect with my distant cousins and meet their spouses for the first time. One morning, I woke up early to walk the neighborhood and take in the scenery. 
I noticed my cousin's husband was up early as well, sitting at the dining table working on his computer. I glanced at his screen and it was bright blue, no software interfaces, just words and numbers on a lot of lines. It looked like something I had seen in an espionage movie before. (Looking back, it was just the terminal hahaha) So I asked, 
"Hey, why does your screen look like that?". He responds, "Oh, I'm just working on this video game my company is getting ready to launch". Interesting... another bread crumb.

Growing up in the inner city of Detroit, education was not the best. I never got exposed to the real workings behind technology and what made technology "technology". I've only ever been a consumer. The interaction I had with that game developer showed me what it looked like to be a builder.
So, like any curious person I started to look into the field.
